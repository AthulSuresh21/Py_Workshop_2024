# Scientific_computing
This repository contains the problem sets, scripts, notebooks and other stuff pertaining to Drexel Physics Computing Workshop 2023.
The following topics will be covered in the workshop:
1. Basic python and algorithmic approach.
2. Numpy and matplotlib 
4. Scipy and sympy 
What we will do in this workshop:
1. Understand the basics of formulating algorithms and translating them to codes.
2. It is assumed that the participants are familiar with basic python syntax and hence won't cover python syntax specifically.
3. Instead of trying out different features of python and its libraries, the approach will be on problem solving using python instead of just learning the syntax and tools.
4. To understand the use of the python libraries and the commands, a number of general and scientific problems will be uploaded in this page.
5. The participants are expected to think and get their hands dirty by writing codes, instead of just using codes as blackbox methods (don't be code monkeys!).
6. This workshop is primarily aimed at physics graduate students and majority of the content covered will be useful in the graduate coursework as well as research.
7. By the end of this workshop, we hope you will be more comfortable using python, and will be able to make professional plots, wrangle numerical data and solve differential equations, integrals etc. using python, without using pen and paper!
8. Some basic aspects of AI/ML will be discussed, but not in detail.
9. To make the best out of this workshop, please try to complete the problem sets that are uploaded.
10. Group work is encouraged.
