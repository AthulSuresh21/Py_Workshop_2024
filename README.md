# Scientific_computing
This repository contains the problem sets, scripts, notebooks and other stuff pertaining to Drexel Physics Computing Workshop 2023.
The following topics will be covered in the workshop:
1. Basic python and algorithmic approach. (3 hours)
2. Numpy and matplotlib (4 hours)
4. Scipy and sympy (4 hours)
5. pytorch and ChatGPT (as a tool for coding and research) (3 hours)

What we will do in this workshop:
1. Understand the basics of formulating algorithms and translating them to codes.
2. It is assumed that the participants are familiar with basic python syntax and hence won't cover python syntax specifically.
3. Instead of trying out different features of python and its libraries, the approach will be on problem solving using python instead of just learning the syntax and tools.
4. To understand the use of the python libraries and the commands, a number of general and scientific problems will be uploaded in this page.
5. The participants are expected to think and get their hands dirty by writing codes, instead of just using codes as blackbox methods.
